# Core dependencies for FastStyleTransferNode
numpy>=1.19.0          # Compatible with your environment (current: 1.26.4)
Pillow>=9.0.0          # For image processing (current: 10.4.0)
torch>=1.9.0           # For tensor operations (current: 2.5.1)

# Optional TensorFlow components (uncomment to enable enhanced style transfer)
# tensorflow>=2.0.0    # Provides neural style transfer capabilities
# tensorflow-hub>=0.8.0 # Used for pre-trained style transfer models
# tensorflow-estimator # May be required by certain TensorFlow Hub models
# protobuf<=3.20.0     # Specific version to avoid compatibility issues with TensorFlow Hub

# Note: This node includes a fallback implementation that works without 
# TensorFlow, making these dependencies truly optional. The fallback uses
# PIL and NumPy for basic style blending.

# Important: The module will automatically set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python
# to avoid protobuf descriptor issues when using TensorFlow Hub.
